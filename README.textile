picoButtons creates a set of "LibDataBroker":http://github.com/tekkub/libdatabroker-1-1/wikis launchers for the micro buttons (those buttons between the actionbar and bag bar in the default interface).

<em> picoButtons does not provide it's own display, you will need a LDB-based quicklaunch addon. </em>
